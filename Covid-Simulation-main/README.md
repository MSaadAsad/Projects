# Covid-Simulation

The primary objective of this project was two-fold. First, we aimed to model the spread of COVID-19 using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and Euler's method. This mathematical model provided us with a theoretical simulation of how the virus spreads within a community, helping in forecasting the progression of the pandemic.

The second part of the project focused on the application of machine learning to improve the classification and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The key metric to optimize was the accuracy of our classifier algorithm, achieved by appropriately dividing the algorithm into training and testing datasets. Based on the predictions generated from the trained algorithm on the test data, we calculated the accuracy as the ratio of correct classifications to total classifications made. Our decision variables in this case were the weights that could be systematically adjusted to maximize the accuracy.

No explicit constraints were imposed on this optimization process, but we noted that the accuracy values naturally range between 0 and 100 percent, and we expected reasonable boundaries for our decision variables.

The chosen model for classification was a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier. Instead of the traditional learning methods, KNN classifiers operate as "lazy" algorithms, storing the location of each data point. The data input for the classifier consisted of variables such as temperature, WBC count, headache intensity, and cough intensity for each patient, and their COVID-19 test results. These inputs were standardized into z-scores to prevent any potential skewing due to differing units of measurement.

In this system, the input 'k' corresponds to the number of nearest points considered for each unknown case. The model then computes the distance (using the Pythagorean theorem in this instance) between the unknown case and its surrounding points. The most frequent classification among these 'k' points is then designated as the class for the unknown input.

As a greedy algorithm, the KNN model only considers points in the immediate vicinity, which can be a limitation. This makes it potentially susceptible to reaching a local maximum accuracy and overfitting due to its narrow scope. Nevertheless, we experimented with different values of 'k' as hyperparameters to mitigate this issue and optimize the model's performance.

For this project, we focused on COVID-19 (Bagal et. al 2020) as our disease of interest. We made time, measured in days, our independent variable and treated it as discrete for our modeling purposes, despite its continuous nature. Our simulation was targeted at Suwon, a city in South Korea with a population of 1,241,311 at the start of the pandemic (City Council Suwon, n.d.).

We initially set the parameters as follows: susceptible (S) = 1,241,000, infected (I) = 1, and recovered (R) = 1. While these parameters are typically whole numbers, our model treated S, I, and R as continuous due to the approximative nature of our calculations. We also considered two probabilities, b and k, each having units of day-1. The b factor represents the probability of an individual transmitting COVID-19 to another person per day, a combination of the chance of an interaction between a susceptible and infected individual and the likelihood of transmission during such an interaction. The k factor represents the probability of recovery from COVID-19 on any given day. We based the values of b and k for South Korea on data from Choi & Ki (2020). While k is mainly dependent on factors like the virus strain and the individual's immune system, we can attempt to reduce b by limiting interpersonal interactions and enhancing preventive measures.

We utilized Euler's method for our SIR model as it aids in finding numerical solutions when it's challenging to integrate a differential equation analytically. It starts with initial conditions for S, I, and R, a specified step size, and the coefficients b and k from the differential equations. The method then calculates the value of dy/dt and adds it to the previously approximated value of y. As the step size is finite, our approximations accumulate over iterations, and the smaller the step size, the closer we get to the exact analytical solution.

In our average scenario, COVID-19 cases peak at 200,000 on day 400. However, even slight alterations in the values of b and k can cause significant variability in this estimation. An increase in b results in a quicker and sharper peak, while an increase in k leads to a lower peak as people recover faster, thereby limiting the spread of the virus. These simulations use the upper and lower confidence intervals for the parameters, illustrating a range of potential pandemic outcomes, urging us to prepare not just for the best-case scenario, but also for the worst.

Still, it's essential to note the assumptions made, like constant infectivity rate throughout the infection, absence of vaccinations, perpetual immunity post-infection, and a static population size. The model also didn't account for measures like lockdowns or quarantines, which significantly impact the virus's spread. Real-world data from Suwon city revealed that cases never reached 200,000, highlighting the crucial role of preventive measures against COVID-19.
